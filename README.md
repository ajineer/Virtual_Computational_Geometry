## âœ¨ What is VCG?

**Virtual Computational Geometry (VCG)** is a revolutionary approach to software development that reimagines the way developers interact with backend systems. Instead of files and folders, logic and data are represented as **interactive, transformable 3D geometry** â€” in virtual reality or 3D environments.

## ðŸ§  The Core Vision

- A server architecture becomes a **walkable 3D space**.
- Each module (controller, DTO, service, etc...) is a **cuboid or shape** with real logic.
- **Rotating**, **scaling**, or **transforming** shapes **changes live behavior**:
  - Rotation swaps view states (mobile vs desktop)
  - Scaling adjusts variable scope
  - Disconnections act as toggles or "commenting out" code
- You donâ€™t read your code â€” you **inhabit it**.

## ðŸ“š Origin

This idea was conceived by **Mark Pierce** in April 2025. It has not been previously published or demonstrated in this exact form.

This repository serves as a **proof of authorship** and the **launch point** for what may one day become an IDE, VR programming platform, or fully immersive development environment.

## ðŸš€ The Future of VCG

This repository is just the beginning. Development may include:
- A prototype in WebXR, Unity, or Three.js
- A dynamic code mapper (AST â†’ Geometry)
- Support for React, Express, or full-stack backends
- A programmable, shape-based development interface
